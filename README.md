=========
This is a full working panoramic system for DSLR camera. 
This system operates as https://github.com/tnedev/CanonPano but without the keypad/lcd interface. Instead, values are writen and saved to a file on a sd card. 

The panorama machine is a robotic device that facilitates the creation
of photographic 360-degree panoramas. In order to create these panoramas,
it is necessary for the camera to rotate 360 degrees over a fixed axis
aligned with the lens nodal point.


Hardware: stepper motor,sd card reader,infrared remote control and Arduino nano. 
Schematics: https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B4ug1BkeuYdWRWhWMXp3QnlOSGs pdf file.
